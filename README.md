Part 1 - 
The dataset is obtained from Kaggle. As we start with 'Hello World!!' program in every programming languages, titanic dataset is one of the first dataset every aspiring Data Enthusiast should start with.
This model predicts the best regression technique when we compare between Linear & Logistic Regression Models. It tells us about the survival or deceased percentage in that disaster.

Part 2 -
It describes the regresssion model in terms of regularization technique. The two techiques involved are Ridge and Lasso regressions. Regularization helps in optimizing the model in order to overcome "Overfitting" conditions. The aim is to reduce mean squared error(mse) as much possible and to get the best accuracy score close to zero.
